# Building a Book Management System

## Assignment

For a Laravel PHP developer, the assignment to build a RESTful API for a book management system can be restructured as follows, emphasizing Laravel's features and PHP as the primary language:

## Description

In this challenge, I have successfully developed a RESTful API for a book management system using PHP with the Laravel framework. I have completed all the required tasks, including CRUD operations for book records, integrating a relational database, conducting validation and error handling, implementing security features, writing comprehensive tests, and documenting the API endpoints.

## Functionality

The API allows users to perform CRUD operations on book records, ensuring that each record includes an ID, title, author, and publication year. The responses are formatted in JSON, and proper validation and error handling are implemented to ensure data integrity and security.

## Setup and Testing

To test the functionality of the API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `composer install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Run `npm install` to install the necessary Node.js dependencies.
5. Configure the database settings in the `.env` file.
6. Run `php artisan migrate` to migrate the database schema.
7. Start the development server by running `php artisan serve`.
8. Use an API client (e.g., Postman) to interact with the endpoints or run `php artisan test` to execute the automated tests.

## Evaluation

I have thoroughly tested the API to ensure its correctness and functionality. All endpoints are properly documented, and the codebase adheres to clean, organized, and best practices coding standards. Exception handling is implemented to manage unexpected situations gracefully, and comprehensive test coverage is provided to validate the API's behavior.

## Submission

I am submitting the completed project along with this README.md file as per the submission guidelines. The project demonstrates my proficiency in developing RESTful APIs with Laravel and PHP, showcasing my ability to leverage Laravel's capabilities effectively.
